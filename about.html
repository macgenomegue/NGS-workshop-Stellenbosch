<p>Prof Pieter Gouws​ 
Professor of Food Microbiology at the Department of Food Science,Stellenbosch University & Deputy Dean – teaching and learning at the Faculty of AgriSciences ​
His current research interests focuses on novel and innovative applications for the detection and control of unwanted bacteria in food, improvement of food safety and food quality, novel processing technologies and antibiotic resistance of foodborne bacteria. He is the author of various scientific papers and educates undergraduate and postgraduate students in the field of food safety.  He was also an instrumental role player in the establishment of the Centre for Food Safety at Stellenbosch University.
<p> Prof Séamus Fanning graduated with a BSc degree in Biochemistry from University College Cork in 1983.  He subsequently obtained his PhD (from UCC) in molecular microbiology in 1990 and his DSc in 2023.
In 2002 Professor Fanning was appointed to the Chair of Food Safety & Zoonoses at University College Dublin, and is the Director of the UCD-Centre for Food Safety.  Current research themes of the Centre include studies related to antimicrobial resistance; bacterial transmission across the food chain and these are focused at extending our understanding of those mechanisms, that enable bacteria to adapt to food production environments.  This research work is underpinned using molecular methods, including next generation sequencing (NGS), among others.  Professor Fanning’s research group has an interest in Salmonella and Cronobacter, related to low-moisture conditions and associated food matrices, such as powdered infant formula (PIF).  
Professor Fanning has published more than 356 original experimental papers, along with 32 review papers, 28 book chapters and two text books.  He is a member of the editorial boards of International journals including, Foodborne Pathogens & Disease; Journal of Food Protection; Microbial Drug Resistance; One Health Advances and an Editor of a further two journals Research in Microbiology & FEMS Microbiology Letters.
In 2019, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.
<p> Dr Guerrino Macori is an Assistant Professor at the School of Biology and Environmental Science and PI at the Centre for Food Safety (CFS). His current research focuses on the application of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches for the diagnosis and epidemiology of microorganisms that are transmitted with foods, that might be responsible for infections and also have beneficial functionalities for human health both as a singular agent and most importantly, in complex microbial communities.
His research focuses on exploring the "microbial dark matter", aiming to discover unknown aspects of microbes using advanced genomics and multi-omics integration. His work covers diverse environments and provides key insights for health, agriculture, and environmental sustainability, while also preparing future researchers in this exciting field.
