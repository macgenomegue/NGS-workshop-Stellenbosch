    <p><strong>Prof Pieter Gouws</strong></p>
    <p>He is Professor of Food Microbiology at the Department of Food Science, Stellenbosch University & Deputy Dean – teaching and learning at the Faculty of AgriSciences.</p>
    <p>His current research interests focus on novel and innovative applications for the detection and control of unwanted bacteria in food, improvement of food safety and food quality, novel processing technologies and antibiotic resistance of foodborne bacteria. He is the author of various scientific papers and educates undergraduate and postgraduate students in the field of food safety. He was also an instrumental role player in the establishment of the Centre for Food Safety at Stellenbosch University.</p>

    <img src="img/SF.jpg" alt="Prof Séamus Fanning" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;"/>
    <p><strong>Prof Séamus Fanning</strong></p>
    <p>He graduated with a BSc degree in Biochemistry from University College Cork in 1983. He subsequently obtained his PhD (from UCC) in molecular microbiology in 1990 and his DSc in 2023.</p>
    <p>In 2002, Professor Fanning was appointed to the Chair of Food Safety & Zoonoses at University College Dublin, and is the Director of the UCD-Centre for Food Safety. Current research themes of the Centre include studies related to antimicrobial resistance; bacterial transmission across the food chain and these are focused at extending our understanding of those mechanisms that enable bacteria to adapt to food production environments. This research work is underpinned using molecular methods, including next generation sequencing (NGS), among others. Professor Fanning’s research group has an interest in Salmonella and Cronobacter, related to low-moisture conditions and associated food matrices, such as powdered infant formula (PIF). He has published more than 356 original experimental papers, along with 32 review papers, 28 book chapters, and two textbooks. He is a member of the editorial boards of international journals, including Foodborne Pathogens & Disease; Journal of Food Protection; Microbial Drug Resistance; One Health Advances and is an Editor of a further two journals: Research in Microbiology & FEMS Microbiology Letters. In 2019, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.</p>

    <img src="img/GM.JPG" alt="Dr Guerrino Macori" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;"/>
    <p><strong>Dr Guerrino Macori</strong></p>
    <p>He is an Assistant Professor in Applied Bioinformatics at the School of Biology and Environmental Science at University College Dublin and PI at the Centre for Food Safety. His current research focuses on the application of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches for the diagnosis and epidemiology of microorganisms that are transmitted with foods, that might be responsible for infections and also have beneficial functionalities for human health both as a singular agent and most importantly, in complex microbial communities. His research focuses on exploring the "microbial dark matter," aiming to discover unknown aspects of microbes using advanced genomics and multi-omics integration. His work covers diverse environments and provides key insights for health, agriculture, and environmental sustainability, while also preparing future researchers in this exciting field.</p>

    <img src="img/Christina.jpg" alt="Dr Christina Killian" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 200px; height: auto;"/>
    <p><strong>Dr Christina Killian</strong></p>
    <p>She graduated with a BSc in Biochemistry from University College Cork (UCC) in 2016.  She was awarded an Eli Lilly scholarship and obtained her PhD in 2023 from UCC.  This research work focused on investigating the nature of the gut metabolome, specifically on the role of bile- and fatty-acid metabolism and associated functionality in aging and life-stage related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s. She is continuing a career in science as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Dublin.  Her research interests centre on the application of bacterial genome sequencing to decipher phenotypes of importance to public health.  This includes elucidating the composition of the microbiota in selected ecological niches and understanding how their metabolism confers adaptability.
